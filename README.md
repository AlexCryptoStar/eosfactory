EOS Factory is a smart-contract development framework, created by [Tokenika](https://tokenika.io).

It's going to have a similar functionality to Ethereum's [Truffle Framework](http://truffleframework.com/).

Using a single command-line interface you'll be able to create a private testnet and then compile, unit-test and deploy [EOS](https://eos.io/) smart-contracts.

It's composed of two layers:
- C++ bridge connected to an EOS node running a private testnet
- Python wrapper acting as a convenient human-oriented interface

Using Python will allow us to build [interactive tutorials](http://eosfactory.io/docs/) for EOS smart-contracts.

EOS Factory is still under development. We plan to release it before June 2018.
