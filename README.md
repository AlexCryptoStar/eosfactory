EOS Factory is a smart-contract development framework, made by [Tokenika](https://tokenika.io/) for compiling, testing and deploying [EOS](https://eos.io/) smart-contracts.

It's going to have a similar functionality to Ethereum's [Truffle Framework](http://truffleframework.com/).

It will be composed of two layers:
* C++ bridge connected to an EOS node running a private testnet
* Python wrapper acting as a convenient human-oriented interface

Using Python will allow us to build [interactive tutorials](http://eosfactory.io/docs/) for EOS smart-contracts.

EOS Factory is still under development. We plan to release it before June 2018.
