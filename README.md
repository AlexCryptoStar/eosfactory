# Welcome to EOSFactory

[EOSFactory](http://eosfactory.io/) is a smart-contract development framework, created by [Tokenika](https://tokenika.io).

It's going to have a similar functionality to Ethereum's [Truffle Framework](http://truffleframework.com/).

Using a single command-line interface you'll be able to create a private testnet and then compile, unit-test and deploy [EOS](https://eos.io/) smart-contracts.

## Architecture

EOSFactory is composed of two layers:
- C++ bridge connected to an EOS node running a private testnet
- Python wrapper acting as a convenient human-oriented interface

Using Python will allow us to build [interactive tutorials](http://eosfactory.io/sphinx/) for EOS smart-contracts.

## Truly cross-platform

We make sure everything we do is fully compatible with Windows - our toolset will enable you to run an EOS node and interact with it on any operating system, including Windows.

## Roadmap

EOS Factory is still under development. We plan to release it before June 2018.
