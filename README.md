[EOS Factory](http://eosfactory.io/) is a smart-contract development framework, created by [Tokenika](https://tokenika.io).

It's going to have a similar functionality to Ethereum's [Truffle Framework](http://truffleframework.com/).

Using a single command-line interface you'll be able to create a private testnet and then compile, unit-test and deploy [EOS](https://eos.io/) smart-contracts.

It's composed of two layers:
- C++ bridge connected to an EOS node running a private testnet
- Python wrapper acting as a convenient human-oriented interface

Using Python will allow us to build [interactive tutorials](http://eosfactory.io/docs/sphinx/) for EOS smart-contracts.

Also, we make sure everything we do is fully compatible with Windows - our toolset will enable you to run an EOS node and interact with it on any operating system, including Windows.

EOS Factory is still under development. We plan to release it before June 2018.
