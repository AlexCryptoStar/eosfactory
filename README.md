LOGOS is a framework for compiling, testing and deploying EOS smart-contracts, similar to Ethereum's [Truffle Framework](http://truffleframework.com).

It's composed of two layers:

* C++ interface for interacting with an EOS node (similar to block.one's cleos)
* Python interface which is a convenient human-oriented wrapper around the above C++ interface

Using Python allows us to build a high quality documentation and tutorials:
