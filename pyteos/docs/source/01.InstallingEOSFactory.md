# Installing EOSFactory

The purpose of this tutorial is to demonstrate how to install EOSFactory on any operating system, including Windows, MacOS and Linux.

We've tested EOSFactory on the following platforms:

- Windows 10 (version 1709)
- Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
- MacOS 10.13.4

**NOTE:**  EOSFactory is compatible with the latest EOSIO release, i.e. `dawn-v.4.0`.

## Prerequisites

* If you're on Windows, we assume that you have [*Windows Subsystem for Linux*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux) installed. If that's not the case, please refer to [this guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).
* We also assume that you have successfully installed *EOSIO* on your machine. If that's not the case, please refer to [this guide](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/wiki/Local-Environment).
* And finally we assume you have [Python 3.5](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/) installed (this refers to MacOS and Linux only, as *Windows Subsystem for Linux* ships with Python3 by default).

**NOTE:** If you are on Windows 10, the only option you have regarding *EOSIO* installation is building it in the Ubuntu bash (supplied by *Windows Subsystem for Linux*), as it cannot be compiled directly on a Windows machine. What we recommend is clone the *EOSIO* source code in Windows, but build it in the Ubuntu bash, taking advantage of the fact that the entire Windows file structure is fully accessible in the Ubuntu bash.

## Build EOSFactory

Clone EOSFactory source code from the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/tokenika/eosfactory.git
```

Open a bash terminal (if you are on Windows use the bash supplied by *Windows Subsystem for Linux*) and navigate to the `eosfactory` folder:

```
cd eosfactory
```

Then run the `build` script:

```
./build.sh -e /path/to/your/local/EOSIO/repository
```

**NOTE:** Make sure to supply the correct path - it's meant to be the path to the *EOSIO* source code that you have cloned from the official [EOSIO repository](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos). In our case the path is `/mnt/d/Workspaces/EOS/eos` but yours will most probably be different:

```
./build.sh -e /mnt/d/Workspaces/EOS/eos
```

## Windows Subsystem for Linux

If you are on Windows, we are assuming *Windows Subsystem for Linux* is located in this directory:

```
%LocalAppData%\\Packages\\CanonicalGroupLimited.UbuntuonWindows_79rhkp1fndgsc
```

If you have the latest *Windows Subsystem for Linux* release this assumption is valid. However, if your WSL is in a different location, please set your `HOME` user variable manually using this bash command:

```
setx.exe "HOME" %LocalAppData%\\Packages\\CanonicalGroupLimited.UbuntuonWindows_79rhkp1fndgsc\\LocalState\\rootfs\\home\\$USER
```

If you are unsure what the path is in your case, open *Windows Explorer* and navigate to the  `%LocalAppData%\\Packages` folder and search for `rootfs`.

## Test EOSFactory

In the bash terminal, let's verify that EOSFactory works and is properly hooked up to *EOSIO*.

If you have a new EOSFactory installation and you haven't done so already, reload `bashrc`:

```
source ~/.bashrc
```

Then run this simple unit-test:

```
source ~/.bashrc
cd eosfactory
python3 ./tests/test1.py
```

If everything works, at the end of the test output you should see this label:

```
Test OK
```
