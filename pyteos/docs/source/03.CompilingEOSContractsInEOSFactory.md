# Compiling EOS Contracts in *EOSFactory*

The purpose of this tutorial is to demonstrate how *EOSFactory* and its Python CLI can be used to make compiling EOS contracts easy & intuitive.

## Prerequisites

* This tutorial assumes that you have successfully installed *EOSFactory*. If it's not the case, please refer to [Installing *EOSFactory*](01.InstallingEOSFactory.html).
* We also assume that you are familiar with the material covered in [Interacting with EOS Contracts in *EOSFactory*](02.InteractingWithEOSContractsInEOSFactory.html).
* Finally, we assume that you are familiar with the official [EOS Hello World tutorial](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/wiki/Tutorial-Hello-World-Contract), as it presents the default way to compile and deploy smart-contracts in EOS. What we present here is an alternative.

## Set up the Workspace

In *Visual Studio Code*, switch to the bash terminal and type `python3` to run the Python CLI. The prompt should change to `>>>` signifying that it's ready for Python commands.

## Create a Contract Template

First, start the testnet and initialize the workspace:

```
import node
node.reset()
```

```
import sess
sess.init()
```

To create a new contract from a pre-defined template use the `Template` class:

```
from eosf import *
contract = Template("hello")
```

To check the directory where the contract's files are located:

```
contract.path()
```

## Add C++ code

Edit the `hello.cpp` file in *Visual Studio Code* and add the following content to it:

```
#include <eosiolib/eosio.hpp>
#include <eosiolib/print.hpp>
using namespace eosio;

class hello : public eosio::contract {
  public:
      using contract::contract;

      /// @abi action 
      void hi( account_name user ) {
         print( "Hello, ", name{user} );
      }
};

EOSIO_ABI( hello, (hi) )
```

## Compile the Contract

You can generate ABI and the web assembly code separately:

```
contract.abi()
```

```
contract.wast()
```

Or you can generate both at the same time:

```
contract.build()
```

## Deploy the Contract

Now we can deploy the compiled contract:

```
contract.deploy()
```

## Test the Contract

We can play with the contract giving it different arguments:

```
contract.push_action("hi", '{"user":"alice"}', sess.alice)
```

```
contract.push_action("hi", '{"user":"carol"}', sess.alice)
```

All the above variations should work, as the contract allows anyone to authorize it.

## Modify the code, re-compile & re-deploy

And now let's modify the `hi` method to make it authenticate the user we are dealing with:

```
void hi( account_name user ) {
	require_auth( user );
	print( "Hello, ", name{user} );
}
```

Re-compile the contract:

```
contract.build()
```

You might want to reset the testnet (but it's optional):

```
node.reset()
sess.init()
```

And finally, re-deploy the contract:

```
contract.deploy()
```

Now, if we attempt to mismatch the user and the authority, the contract will throw an error:

```
contract.push_action("hi", '{"user":"carol"}', sess.alice)
```

```
"error":{"code":3030001,"name":"tx_missing_auth","what":"missing required authority"...
```

But if we use the appropriate authority, there should no error:

```
contract.push_action("hi", '{"user":"carol"}', sess.carol)
```
