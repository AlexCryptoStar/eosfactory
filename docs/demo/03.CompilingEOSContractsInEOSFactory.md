# Compiling EOS Contracts in *EOSFactory*

The purpose of this tutorial is to demonstrate how *EOSFactory* and its Python syntax can be used to make compiling EOS contracts easy & intuitive.

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that you have successfully installed *EOSFactory*. If it's not the case, please refer to [this guide](InstallingEOSFactory.md).

We also assume that you are familiar with the material covered in [Getting Started with EOS Contracts in *EOSFactory*](GettingStartedwithEOSContractsinEOSFactory.md).

Finally, we assume that you are familiar with the official [EOS Hello World tutorial](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/wiki/Tutorial-Hello-World-Contract), as it presents the default way to compile and deploy smart-contracts in EOS. What we present is an alternative.

## Set up the Workspace

In *Visual Studio Code*, switch to the Bash console and type `python3` to run the Python CLI. The prompt should change to `>>>` signifying that it's ready for Python commands.

Next, import the *EOSFactory* Python toolset:

```
import pyteos
```

Then start the testnet:

```
$ node.run()
```

And initialize the workspace:

```
$ init()
```

## Create a Contract Template

To create a contract template:

```
$ template = pyteos.Template("hello")
```

To check the path where the contract's files are located:

```
$ template.path()
```

## Add C++ code

Add the following content to the `hello.cpp` file:

```
#include <eosiolib/eosio.hpp>
#include <eosiolib/print.hpp>
using namespace eosio;

class hello : public eosio::contract {
  public:
      using contract::contract;

      /// @abi action 
      void hi( account_name user ) {
         print( "Hello, ", name{user} );
      }
};

EOSIO_ABI( hello, (hi) )
```

## Compile the Contract

You can generate the web assembly code and ABI separately:

```
wast(template)
```

```
abi(template)
```

Or you can generate both at the same time:

```
compile(template)
```

## Deploy the Contract

Now we can deploy the compiled contract and keep reference to it for future use:

```
contract = Contract("hello")
```

## Test the Contract

We can play with the contract giving it different arguments:

```
$ contract.push_action("hi", '{"user":"alice"}', alice)
```

```
$ contract.push_action("hi", '{"user":"carol"}', alice)
```

All the above variations should work, as the contract allows anyone to authorize it.

## Modify the code, re-compile & re-deploy

And now let's modify the `hi` method to make it authenticate the user we are dealing with:

```
void hi( account_name user ) {
	require_auth( user );
	print( "Hello, ", name{user} );
}
```

And then re-compile and re-deploy it:

```
compile(template)
```

```
contract = Contract("hello")
```

Now if we attempt to mismatch the user and the authority, the contract will throw an error:

```
contract.push_action("hi", '{"user":"carol"}', alice)
```

```
Error 3030001: missing required authority
Ensure that you have the related authority inside your transaction!;
Error Details:
missing authority of carol
```
