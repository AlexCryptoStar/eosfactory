# Installing *EOSFactory*

*EOSFactory* is a truly cross-platform tool. The purpose of this tutorial is to demonstrate how to install it on any operating system, including Windows, Mac and Linux.

## Prerequisites

* If you're on Windows 10, we assume that you have *Windows Subsystem for Linux* installed. If that's not the case, please refer to [this guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).
* We also assume that you have successfully installed *EOSIO*. If that's not the case, please refer to [this guide](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/wiki/Local-Environment). Note: if you are on Windows, the only option you have is to install *EOSIO* in the Linux bash, as EOS source code is not compatible with Windows.
* Finally, *EOSFactory* works perfectly with *Visual Studio Code*. To install it, please refer to [this webpage](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

## Get the source code

Clone *EOSFactory* source code from our repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/tokenika/eosfactory.git
```

## Set up Visual Studio Code (VSC)

Run VSC and open the `eosfactory` folder.

In you are on Windows, navigate to `Preferences -> Settings` and overwrite the default configuration for the `terminal.integrated.shell.windows` option:

```
"terminal.integrated.shell.windows": "C:\\Windows\\sysnative\\bash.exe"
```

## Build *EOSFactory*

Still in VSC, open the bash terminal, navigate to the `eosfactory` folder and run the build script:

```
./ build.sh
```

## Run Python CLI

If everything has gone smoothly, in the Bash terminal type `python3` to run the Python CLI. The prompt should change to `>>>` signifying that it's ready for Python commands.

Next, import the *EOSFactory* Python toolset:

```
import pyteos
```

We'll verify that *EOSFactory* works and is properly hooked up to *EOSIO* by attempting to start a local testnet:

```
node.run()
```

Assuming everything has worked properly, you should see a new console window pop up and a block generation message appearing there every 0.5 seconds:

```
eosio generated block 046b9984... #101527 @ 2018-05-01T14:24:58.000 with 0 trxs
```

To stop the testnet:

```
node.stop()
```

And to exit the Python CLI and get back to the Bash terminal prompt:

```
exit()
```
