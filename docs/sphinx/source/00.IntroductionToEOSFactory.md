# Introduction to EOSFactory

[EOSFactory](http://eosfactory.io/) is a smart-contract development framework, created by [Tokenika](https://tokenika.io).

The goal is to achieve a similar functionality to Ethereum's [Truffle Framework](http://truffleframework.com/).

Using a single command-line interface you can create a private testnet and then compile, unit-test and deploy [EOS](https://eos.io/) smart-contracts.

All of this using simple yet powerful [Python3](https://www.python.org/) syntax.

## Architecture

EOSFactory is composed of two layers:

- C++ bridge connected to an EOS node running a private testnet
- Python wrapper acting as a convenient human-oriented interface

## Main features

#### Object-oriented

When you use tools like `cleos` all you have at your disposal is issuing commands  - `cleos` does not keep your state. Each time you interact with a contract, you need to tell `cleos` which contract and which account you mean. Contrary to that, in EOSFactory everything is an object. You create a contract, keep reference to it and then invoke its various methods.

#### Simple syntax

The front-end of EOSFactory is simply a Python3 CLI. This way you can interact with EOS smart-contract, and prove it works as expected, without having to deal with the complexity of a low-level language like C++. In most cases Python's syntax is clear for everyone.

#### Real testnet

As EOS full node is very quick we don't need to rely on a testnet simulator similar to [TestRPC](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli) in Ethereum. Instead, we can work with a real testnet and this makes unit-tests much more reliable. Thus EOSFactory has the ability to launch and tear down an EOS testnet in a very efficient way, so that you can fully test your smart-contract in a couple of seconds and do it multiple times.

## Disclaimer

At this stage EOSFactory is just a proof-of-concept solution for smart-contract unit-testing. A lot of stuff is still missing, for example:

* We don't handle errors properly and we don't offer proper assertions. 
* There is no clear separation between EOSFactory source code and a user's workspace where all his contracts & unit-tests are stored.

Those features will be supplied in the subsequent releases.

What we have right now are just toy examples, but they interact with a real testnet. Hopefully it's a solid foundation for building a robust toolset.
