# EOSFactory Release Notes - Version 0.8

## What works in this release

Using Python commands you currently can:

* launch a single-node private testnet and fully control it: stop it and then continue running it or completely reset it,
* initialize the testnet with the `bios` contract and several test accounts available as `sess.alice`, `sess.bob ` and `sess.carol`,
* create additional test accounts (their keys are automatically imported into the wallet),
* manage the wallet,
* easy access to demo contracts stored in the `contracts` folder of the *EOSIO* source code (you can instantiate them in EOSFactory by passing their folder name in the `Contract` class constructor),
* compile a contract, both ABI & WAST (but please note that the ABI compiler has an experimental status in *EOSIO* repository),
* create a new contract from a pre-defined template (this includes the creation of its *CMake* files),
* deploy a contract (the account holding the contract is created behind the scenes),
* interact with a contract by pushing actions to it,
* extract text messages logged by the contract (i.e. a contract's output stream produced by its `print()` method),
* extract data from a contract's table,
* run a simple unit-test utilizing all the above features.

## Current limitations

* Currently unit-tests in EOSFactory are just na√Øve demo examples. They don't have proper assertions, don't handle errors properly and they don't have proper tear-down methods.
* You cannot connect EOSFactory to a testnet of your choice, only to a private one running a single node.
* Whereas the `nodeos` process runs in the background on MacOS, on other platforms (Windows & Ubuntu) it requires launching a separate terminal window (it's done automatically though). This might be a limitation for GUI-less systems like Ubuntu Server edition.
* There are no utilities for debugging contracts, except for the "caveman" style, i.e. accessing the output stream produced by its `print()` method.
* There is no easy way to work with smart-contracts stored outside of EOSFactory `contracts` folder or EOSIO `contracts` folder. If you want to do that you need to refer to the contract folder by its full path.
* The `Template` class constructor only accepts a folder name, not a path (this is different from the `Contract` constructor which accepts both).
* The `Contract` class `abi()` and `build()` methods are relying on the *EOSIO* ABI compiler which has an experimental status in the *EOSIO* repository. Thus the ABI output might be different than expected.
* The `Contract` class `push_action()` and `show_action` methods accept only verbose input, i.e. all action's parameters must be named in the JSON syntax.
