# Unit-testing EOS Contracts in *EOSFactory*

The purpose of this tutorial is to demonstrate how *EOSFactory* and its Python CLI can be used to make unit-testing EOS contracts easy & intuitive.

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that you have successfully installed *EOSFactory*. If it's not the case, please refer to [this guide](InstallingEOSFactory.md).

We also assume that you are familiar with the material covered in [Getting Started with EOS Contracts in *EOSFactory*](GettingStartedwithEOSContractsinEOSFactory.md).

Finally, we assume that you are familiar with the official [EOS Hello World tutorial](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/wiki/Tutorial-Hello-World-Contract), as it presents the default way to compile and deploy smart-contracts in EOS. What we present is an alternative.

## Set up the Workspace

In *Visual Studio Code*, switch to the Bash console and type `python3` to run the Python CLI. The prompt should change to `>>>` signifying that it's ready for Python commands.

Next, import the *EOSFactory* Python toolset:

```
import pyteos
```

Then start the testnet:

```
node.reset()
```

And initialize the workspace:

```
node.init()
```
