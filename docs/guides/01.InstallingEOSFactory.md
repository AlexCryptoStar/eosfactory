# Installing *EOSFactory*

*EOSFactory* is a truly cross-platform tool. The purpose of this tutorial is to demonstrate how to install it on any operating system, including Windows, Mac and Linux.?

## Prerequisites

* If you're on Windows 10, we assume that you have *Windows Subsystem for Linux* installed. If that's not the case, please refer to [this guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).
* We also assume that you have successfully installed *EOSIO*. If that's not the case, please refer to [this guide](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/wiki/Local-Environment). Note: if you are on Windows, the only option you have is to install *EOSIO* in the Linux bash, as EOS source code is not compatible with Windows.
* Finally, *EOSFactory* works perfectly with *Visual Studio Code*. To install it, please refer to [this webpage](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

## Get the source code

Clone *EOSFactory* source code from our repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/tokenika/eosfactory.git
```

## Set up Visual Studio Code (VSC)

Run VSC and open the `eosfactory` folder.

In you are on Windows, navigate to `Preferences -> Settings` and overwrite the default configuration for the `terminal.integrated.shell.windows` option:

```
"terminal.integrated.shell.windows": "C:\\Windows\\sysnative\\bash.exe"
```

## Build *EOSFactory* on Linux

Still in VSC, open the bash terminal and define an environment variable called `EOSIO_SOURCE_DIR`:

```
echo 'export EOSIO_SOURCE_DIR=/path/to/your/local/EOSIO/repository' >> ~/.bashrc
```

**NOTE:** Make sure to supply the correct path - it's meant to be the path to the *EOSIO* source code that you have cloned and built from the official [EOSIO repository](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos). In our case the path is `/~/Workspaces/EOS/eos` but yours will most probably be different:

```
echo 'export EOSIO_SOURCE_DIR=~/Workspaces/EOS/eos' >> ~/.bashrc
```

Apply the above change to your bash console:

```
source ~/.bashrc
```

Finally, navigate to the `eosfactory` folder and run the build script:

```
cd eosfactory
chmod +x build.sh
sudo ./build.sh
```

**NOTE:** When the build process is finished you'll need to restart your VSC bash terminal.

## Build *EOSFactory* on Windows

Still in VSC, open the bash terminal and define an environment variable called `EOSIO_SOURCE_DIR`:

```
echo 'export EOSIO_SOURCE_DIR=/path/to/your/local/EOSIO/repository' >> ~/.bashrc
```

**NOTE:** Make sure to supply the correct path - it's meant to be the path to the *EOSIO* source code that you have cloned and built from the official [EOSIO repository](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos). In our case the path is `/mnt/d/Workspaces/EOS/eos` but yours will most probably be different:

```
echo 'export EOSIO_SOURCE_DIR=/mnt/d/Workspaces/EOS/eos' >> ~/.bashrc
```

Apply the above change to your bash console:

```
source ~/.bashrc
```

Next, still in the VSC bash terminal run this command to define a Windows user variable pointing to your Ubuntu home directory as seen from the Windows file system perspective:

```
setx.exe "HOME" "path\\to\\your\\ubuntu\\home\\directory"
```

**NOTE:** Make sure to supply the correct path - most probably it will be similar to this:

```
%LocalAppData%\\Packages\\CanonicalGroupLimited.UbuntuonWindows_79rhkp1fndgsc\\LocalState\\rootfs\\home\\$USER
```

If so, the entire command will be this: 

```
setx.exe "HOME" %LocalAppData%\\Packages\\CanonicalGroupLimited.UbuntuonWindows_79rhkp1fndgsc\\LocalState\\rootfs\\home\\$USER
```

**NOTE:** If you are unsure what the path is in your case, open *Windows Explorer* and navigate to the  `%LocalAppData%\Packages` folder and search for `rootfs`.

Restart your VSC for the change to take effect and check if the variable `HOME` has been properly set by running this command in the VSC bash terminal:

```
echo $(cmd.exe /c dir %HOME%)
```

You should get a response similar to this:

```
5 Dir(s) 13,115,555,840 bytes...
```

Finally, navigate to the `eosfactory` folder and run the build script:

```
cd eosfactory
./build.sh
```

**NOTE:** When the build process is finished you'll need to restart VSC.

## Test *EOSFactory*

Verify that *EOSFactory* works and is properly hooked up to *EOSIO* by a simple unit-test:

```
python3 ./tests/test1.py
```
