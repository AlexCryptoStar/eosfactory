# Getting Started with EOS Contracts in *EOSFactory* 

The purpose of this tutorial is to demonstrate how *EOSFactory* and its Python CLI can be used to make interacting with EOS easy & intuitive.

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes that you have successfully installed *EOSFactory*. If it's not the case, please refer to [this guide](InstallingEOSFactory.md).

We also assume that you are familiar with the official [EOS tutorials](https://github.com/EOSIO/eos/wiki/Tutorial-Getting-Started-With-Contracts), as they will give you a broader context and explain the rationale behind EOS smart-contracts.

Once you have a good grasp how standard EOS tools like `cleos` and `eosiocpp` work, you'll be able to appreciate how quickly similar tasks can be performed with *EOSFactory*, thus speeding up the smart-contract development cycle.

## Run Python CLI

In *Visual Studio Code*, switch to the Bash console and type `python3` to run the Python CLI. The prompt should change to `>>>` signifying that it's ready for Python commands.

Next, import the *EOSFactory* toolset:

```
import node
```

## Start a Local Testnet

To start your own single-node local testnet:

```
node.reset()
```

Assuming everything has worked properly, you should see a new console window pop up and a block generation message appearing there every 0.5 seconds:

```
eosio generated block 046b9984... #101527 @ 2018-05-01T14:24:58.000 with 0 trxs
```

To get information about the testnet:

```
node.info()
```

## Manage the Local Testnet

#### Stop & continue

To stop and then continue running the testnet:

```
node.stop()
```

Wait a bit until the testnet window disappears, and then:

```
node.run()
```

#### Stop & reset

To stop and reset the testnet:

```
node.stop()
```

Wait a bit until the testnet window disappears, and then:

```
node.reset()
```

## Initialize the Workspace

To initialize the workspace:

```
import sess
```

```
sess.init()
```

The initialization process does the following things:

* deploys the *Bios* contract
* creates a reference to the default `eosio` account
* creates several test accounts: `alice`, `bob` & `carol`
* creates a wallet and imports into it the keys of all the above accounts

If you need additional test accounts, you can easily create them:

```
from eosf import *
```

```
charlie = Account("charlie", sess.eosio)
```

**NOTE:** The first argument indicates the new account's name, whereas the second indicates the master account, in this case the default `eosio` account.

If you need to lock or unlock your wallet, use the `wallet` object to do it:

```
sess.wallet.lock()
```

```
sess.wallet.unlock()
```

## Deploy the EOS Token Contract

To create a reference to an already compiled contract just supply the path to the folder where it's located:

```
from eosf import *
```

```
contract = Contract("/mnt/d/Workspaces/EOS/eos/build/contracts/eosio.token")
```

Alternatively, supply just the name of the folder, if it can be found in a standard location, i.e. `eos/build/contracts` or `eosfactory/contracts`:

```
contract = Contract("eosio.token")
```

And to deploy a contract use its `deploy` method:

```
contract.deploy()
```

**NOTE:** During deployment several things are happening behind the scenes: a new account is created with a new pair of keys and the contract is assigned to this new account.

## Create the EOS Token

To create a new token we call the `create` action on the `eosio.token` contract with the proper arguments for this action:

```
contract.push("create", '{"issuer":"eosio", "maximum_supply":"1000000000.0000 EOS", "can_freeze":0, "can_recall":0, "can_whitelist":0}')
```

**NOTE:** The `push` method takes two arguments: the action name and its arguments in JSON format. Optionally, you can also add a third argument, i.e. the account whose permission is needed, but in this case it's not necessary, as the permission defaults to the account holding the contract.

**NOTE:** If you want to see the actual transaction without broadcasting it, use the `show` method instead of `push`.

## Issue EOS Tokens

Now that we have created the token, the issuer can issue new tokens to `alice`:

```
contract.push("issue", '{"to":"alice", "quantity":"100.0000 EOS", "memo":"memo"}', eosio)
```

**NOTE:** In this case the permission is assigned to the default `eosio` account.

## Transfer EOS Tokens

Now that account `alice` has tokens, we will transfer some to account `carol`.  

```
contract.push("transfer", '{"from":"alice", "to":"carol", "quantity":"25.0000 EOS", "memo":"memo"}', alice)
```

**NOTE:** As the third argument we pass the reference to the account `alice` to indicate that she is the one who authorized this action.

## Check the Contract Table

From the contract's ABI we know that the table keeping track of the token balances is called `accounts`. Let's check the state of both accounts involved in the previous transaction:

```
contract.get("accounts", alice)
```

```
contract.get("accounts", carol)
```

**NOTE:** The `get` method takes two arguments: the name of the table as specified by the contract ABI and the scope within the contract in which the table is found.
