# Multiple (ambiguous) account mapping #31

## Q

### Problem

* A multiple mapping of account_master in the accounts.json file causes unit tests in tic_tac_toe_jungle to fail. When that happens, the only option the user has is remove the mapping manually from the accounts.json file and start over.
* There is no mechanism to prevent a multiple account mapping, while this will surely happen when the user follows the account set-up procedure more than once.


### Suggested solution

Suggested solution
The command eosf.AccountMaster() should be overloaded:

* without a parameter - then we assume that the user wants to create a new account on a public testnet, so we generate for him an account name and keys.
* with the name parameter filled in - then we assume that the user already has an account on the testnet and all he needs is create an AccountMaster object with an existing account name.

Account mapping should no longer be part of the import_key() method. Instead , there should be a separate method just for that, for example:

```md
wallet.import_key(account_master)
eosf.map_account(account_master)
```

The mapping process, i.e. the map_account() command, should always overwrite an existing mapping. This removes the possibility of a multiple (ambiguous) mapping.
