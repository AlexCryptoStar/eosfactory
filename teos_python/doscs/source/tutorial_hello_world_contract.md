# Tutorial Hello World Contract

We will now create our first "hello world" contract. Create a new folder called "hello":
```
import os
contract_dir = "/tmp/hello/"
if not os.path.exists(contract_dir):
    os.makedirs(contract_dir)
```
Create a file "hello.cpp" with the following contents:
```
hello_cpp = open(contract_dir + "hello.cpp", "w")

```
Open the `hello.cpp` file in a text editor. We recommend the *Visual Studio Code*. If you are working with the [*Windows Subsystem for Linux*](#https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10), the location file has to be known in terms of the *Windows* file system. It is something like `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Packages\CanonicalGroupLimited.UbuntuonWindows_79rhkp1fndgsc\LocalState \rootfs\tmp\hello\hello.cpp`.

Copy there the following text:
```
#include <eosiolib/eosio.hpp>
#include <eosiolib/print.hpp>
using namespace eosio;

class hello : public eosio::contract {
  public:
      using contract::contract;

      /// @abi action 
      void hi( account_name user ) {
         print( "Hello, ", name{user} );
      }
};

EOSIO_ABI( hello, (hi) )
```

<!-- ```
file = open(contract_dir + "hello.cpp", "r")
print(file.read())
``` -->
You can compile your code to web assembly (.wast) as follows:
```

```

## Hello World Ricardian Contract

Every smart contract must have a matching [Ricardian contract](#https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricardian_contract). The Ricardian Contract specifies the legally binding behavior associated with each action of the smart contract.

The party receiving such notice shall promptly be removed from being a Block Producer and this Contract shall be automatically terminated. 
  
#### Force Majeure
FORCE MAJEURE. If performance of this Contract or any obligation under this Contract is prevented, restricted, or interfered with by causes beyond either party's reasonable control ("Force Majeure"), and if the party unable to carry out its obligations gives the other party prompt written notice of such event, then the obligations of the party invoking this provision shall be suspended to the extent necessary by such event.
