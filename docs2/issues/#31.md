# Multiple (ambiguous) account mapping #31

## Q

### Problem

1.  A multiple mapping of account_master in the accounts.json file causes unit tests in tic_tac_toe_jungle to fail. When that happens, the only option the user has is remove the mapping manually from the accounts.json file and start over.
2. There is no mechanism to prevent a multiple account mapping, while this will surely happen when the user follows the account set-up procedure more than once.


### Suggested solution

Suggested solution

1.  The command eosf.AccountMaster() should be overloaded:

*   without a parameter - then we assume that the user wants to create a new account on a public testnet, so we generate for him an account name and keys.
*   with the name parameter filled in - then we assume that the user already has an account on the testnet and all he needs is create an AccountMaster object with an existing account name.

2.  Account mapping should no longer be part of the import_key() method. Instead , there should be a separate method just for that, for example:

```md
wallet.import_key(account_master)
eosf.map_account(account_master)
```

3.  The mapping process, i.e. the map_account() command, should always overwrite an existing mapping. This removes the possibility of a multiple (ambiguous) mapping.

## A

The new edition, version 2.0, addresses the problem presented as it is 
explained <a href="https://github.com/tokenika/eosfactory/blob/dev/docs/source/cases/account_name_conflict.md">there.</a>

If a new account object is about to be created, it is checked whether its 
proposed name differs from all the account objects recorded in a json mapping
file. If it is not so, a change of the offending name is proposed.

Point 1 of the suggested solution: implemented, but note that the name is
not enough to posses an account, private keys are needed.

Point 2 of the suggested solution: 
Now, the wallet method 'import_key' is not used (there is no need to use it) 
since account private keys are loaded into the singleton wallet automatically 
just after creation and consistency checks.

Point 3 of the suggested solution:
Is not relevant now as name conflicts are solved dynamically.
